I just noticed this before I was about to upload :)

Ok the projects will not load because of the paths pointing to my system.

If you look in the project file eg mine below.

<Project>
	<Title>Borswe</Title>
	<Language>VBScript</Language>
	<Form>C:\Documents and Settings\Ben\Desktop\VB-Projects\BizCard\Projects\Borswe\Borswe.bfm</Form>
	<unit>C:\Documents and Settings\Ben\Desktop\VB-Projects\BizCard\Projects\Borswe\Borswe.unt</unit>
</Project>

You will need to chnage the paths to point to were the project is on your system. I try and fix this for next time.
