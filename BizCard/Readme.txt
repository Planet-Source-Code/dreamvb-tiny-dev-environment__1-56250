Tiny Development Environment for Windows
----------------------------------------

+ What is it
+ How can I compile it.

-What is it.
Well that is a question in it's own at first this this was ment to be a Business card designer. That you can see form the folder name. Next I desided I wanted to make a Font end menu designer for CD-ROM eg like PCPlus and other Mazaines make. Well after that I desided to use the VBScript control and this is what you have now. I ant chageing my mine agian :)

Well this project was ment to show you how to make use of the VBScript control in Visual Basic. This project allows you to add controls and also code to them. with an easy to use Form Designer. Your programs can be tested in the IDE or also compiled to an EXE file.

-How can I compile it.
If you just want to test your projects in the IDE you just need to open BizCard.vbp and run it. open your project and click the Run button in the IDE. simple.

Now to compile to a Exe you will need to first open up the project exehead\exehead.vbp and compile this to exehead\exehead.exe. for now keep the same exe name exehead.exe or you need to chnage the code.

Now to compile you can open one of the projects to test eg Projects\CdRom\CdRom.proj once you opened this in the Ide click File menu and then click Make Exe. the file will be compiled to the path below

Projects\CdRom\debug\CdRom.exe

And that is all there is to it.

Now at the moment the project only has 5 Controls you can use they are.

Command Button
Label
PictureBox
Text Box
List Box

Also the Controls at this point have now properties box. You have to hard code them in the sum main of the code unit file.

I am at the moment still working on this project and will bring the update soon. some things I will be adding.

Fixing some small bugs.
Adding a Better About Box
Compile to Small but simple user guide.
Add some more controls.
Add a Properties Dialog box. if someone know of a qucik and easy way of doing this let me know of has a control I can use.
Add code helper templates. this will be usefull for beginners. eg For Loops, Do Loops, If Statements, etc
Add Plug-in support.

Ok well I hope you like the code. I know at the moment you can;t do much this was becuase I was in so much of a rush to get something working to show you all. the next update should be a little easy to use and understand.
